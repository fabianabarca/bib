  abstract = {The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing sensors and their observations, the involved procedures, the studied features of interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as actuators. SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture by including a lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) for its elementary classes and properties. With their different scope and different degrees of axiomatization, SSN and SOSA are able to support a wide range of applications and use cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology engineering, and the Web of Things. Both ontologies are described below, and examples of their usage are given.},

A crucial element that affects road safety is driver behavior, because driver errors are usually the principal cause of traffic accidents. Therefore, understanding and modeling human driver behavior is extremely important for the safety of the road transportation. In this paper, a driver behavior model based in ontology for intelligent transportation system is proposed. The ontology will allows predicting different undesirable situations, such as traffic accidents, and road congestion, taking into account the environment information and the driver behavior.},
